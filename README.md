# WFDB-Rust

`wfdb-rust` is a basic library for parsing WFDB-format datasets from PhysioNet. At this time,
it does not intend to be a complete WFDB library; instead, it focuses strictly on reading WFDB
datasets (not writing them).

The motivation for this library was to find an easier way to parse datasets from PhysioNet in
other Rust projects.

Check out the [PhysioNet database][physionet], or see more information about the [WFDB format][wfdb].
